**BSCS Recent Graduate & CS (AI/ML) Graduate Student** Student projects include building forecasting, interpretable ML, and routing/optimization systems in Python—plus solid software engineering in Java/C++. I focus on turning data into clear decisions with tested pipelines, instrumentation, and stakeholder-ready reports. Based in Austin, TX.

## Projects (code private per academic policy: Request read-only access via email)

### AI / ML
- **Air Quality Forecasting (D682)** — XGBoost pipeline on weather/pollution time series; **PM₂.₅ RMSE 4.73 (~3.5% better than baseline)**; SHAP surfaced **dew point/humidity** as key drivers; report + notebooks.  
- **Alzheimer’s Prevalence (D797)** — scikit-learn Pipeline with cross-validation; **leakage audit documented** for a cluster-derived feature; SHAP interpretability; stakeholder readout.  
- **MLIR Operator Fusion Proposal (WGU Project Dev)** — Proposed an MLIR operator-fusion pass for edge inference; authored requirements, architecture, and implementation plan; delivered technical + business proposal; **Certificate of Excellence**.

### Software / Algorithms
- **Emergency Dispatch Simulator (D795)** — Implemented **Dijkstra** & **Floyd–Warshall** with priority triage, timing counters, and full event logging; after all-pairs precompute, **per-call routing latency improved ~7.7×**.  
- **WGUPS Routing** — Custom hash table; nearest-neighbor routing under constraints; **top-5 shortest total mileage in cohort**; CLI for time-based status & mileage; unit-tested, PEP 8.  
- **Fortran → Python Port (D793)** — Translated a legacy Fortran module to Python; added pytest unit/integration tests; validated numerical parity; documented design.  
- **Java Frameworks (D287)** — Spring Boot **MVC** app with Thymeleaf views for parts/products; **JPA** domain with **Many-to-Many** Product↔Part; **custom validators** (price/“enough parts”); H2 seed data; **JUnit 5** tests.
- **Angular Front End (D288)** — Angular 14 SPA with Material UI; vacations/excursions/cart flows; **Router** navigation; **Reactive Forms** with validation; **HttpClient** service + shared state via RxJS; Jasmine/Karma tests.
- **Advanced Java (D387)** — Full-stack **Spring Boot REST** + **Angular** hotel reservation app: endpoints for availability/room lookup/reservation, **JPA/H2** persistence, DTO conversion via **ConversionService**, i18n with a multi-threaded service, Angular 14 UI under `src/main/UI`, **Dockerfile** for containerized deploy, **JUnit 5** context test. 
- **C++ Class Roster (C867)** — OOP roster app parsing CSV into student objects; add/remove by ID; average days-in-course; email validation; filter by degree; destructor frees memory.
